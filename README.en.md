# winxp quick boot


#### Introduction
This is software written n years ago, open source;

Winxp Flash Start is a software that allows you **WindowsXP**, **Win2003**** to start quickly when booting up**, to solve your problem of installing large-scale software (such as image processing, design, development, database, game Etc.) caused by slow startup problems. Most machines can enter "Welcome" after one lap. With recovery function. When there is no registration, the software will lock your "Registry Editor" and "Group Policy Window", and the "Winodws Quick Start" logo will be added if you are welcome. To restore, press the "Restore" button to restore.
